# Arrays

## What is an Array?

- An array is a data structure used to store a collection of elements of the same type. Elements are stored at contiguous memory locations. Arrays have a fixed size; once declared, the size cannot be changed. Array indexing starts from 0 in most programming languages.

## Usage

- Storing collections: Arrays store multiple elements under a single variable.

## Examples:

- Array of integers.
- Array of strings (e.g., names of people).
- 2D or multidimensional arrays.

## Operations

- Traversal: Iterating through each element.
- Insertion: Adding an element at a specific index.
- Deletion: Removing an element by its index.
- Updation: Modifying an element's value.
- Searching: Finding an element by value.
- Sorting: Rearranging elements (ascending/descending order).

## Advantages

- Fast access: Constant time O(1) access via index.
- Random access: Any element can be directly accessed using its index.
- Memory efficiency: Elements are stored in adjacent memory blocks.

## Limitations

- Fixed size: Cannot resize after declaration.
- Wasted memory: Unused elements still occupy space.
- Inflexibility: Less suitable for dynamic data compared to linked lists or dynamic arrays.
