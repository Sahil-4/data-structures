# Queue

## What is a Queue?

- A queue is a linear data structure where elements are added at one end (rear) and removed from the other end (front).
- It follows the **First In First Out (FIFO)** principle.

## Usage

- Commonly used in scenarios like process scheduling, job scheduling, and handling requests in buffers.

## Operations

- **Enqueue**: Adds an element to the rear.
- **Dequeue**: Removes an element from the front.
- **isEmpty**: Checks if the queue is empty.
- **isFull**: Checks if the queue is full (for fixed-size queues).
- **Size**: Returns the number of elements in the queue.

## Deque (Double-Ended Queue)

- A **deque** is a special type of queue where elements can be added or removed from both the front and rear.
- Types of Deques:
  - **Input-restricted deque**: Insertion is allowed only at the rear, but deletion can happen at both ends.
  - **Output-restricted deque**: Deletion is allowed only at the front, but insertion can happen at both ends.
- Useful for scenarios requiring both **FIFO** and **LIFO** operations, such as task scheduling or implementing undo mechanisms.

## Stack vs Queue

- A **stack** uses the **LIFO** principle (Last In First Out), while a **queue** uses **FIFO** (First In First Out).
- In a stack, both insertion (push) and deletion (pop) occur at the same end.
- In a queue, insertion (enqueue) happens at the rear, and deletion (dequeue) happens at the front.
- Stacks are ideal for backtracking or undo operations, whereas queues are suitable for scheduling and task processing.

## Advantages

- Maintains order, ensuring the first element added is processed first.
- Simple and efficient for sequential processing tasks.

## Limitations

- Searching for a specific element takes **O(N)** time in an unstructured queue, as elements must be checked sequentially.

## Algorithms

### Enqueue (Add an element to the rear)

1. If the queue is full, return an overflow error.
2. Create a new node with the given value.
3. If the queue is empty:
   - Set both front and rear to the new node.
4. Else:
   - Set the next pointer of the rear to the new node.
   - Update rear to point to the new node.
5. Increase the size of the queue.

### Dequeue (Remove an element from the front)

1. If the queue is empty, return an underflow error.
2. Store the front nodeâ€™s value.
3. Update the front to point to the next node.
4. If the queue becomes empty (front is null), set rear to null.
5. Free the old front node.
6. Decrease the size of the queue.

### Peek Front (Get the front element)

1. If the queue is empty, return an underflow error.
2. Return the value of the front node.

### Peek Rear (Get the rear element)

1. If the queue is empty, return an underflow error.
2. Return the value of the rear node.

### isEmpty (Check if the queue is empty)

1. Return true if the size of the queue is 0.
2. Else, return false.

### Size (Get the number of elements in the queue)

1. Return the current size of the queue.
